\arguments{
\item{data}{a named input vector containing the significance level for
nodes (gene symbols). For this named vector, the element names are gene
symbols, the element values for the significance level (measured as
p-value or fdr). Alternatively, it can be a matrix or data frame with
two columns: 1st column for gene symbols, 2nd column for the
significance level}

\item{network}{the built-in network. Currently two sources of network
information are supported: the STRING database (version 10) and the
Pathways Commons database (version 7). STRING is a meta-integration of
undirect interactions from the functional aspect, while Pathways
Commons mainly contains both undirect and direct interactions from the
physical/pathway aspect. Both have scores to control the confidence of
interactions. Therefore, the user can choose the different quality of
the interactions. In STRING, "STRING_highest" indicates interactions
with highest confidence (confidence scores>=900), "STRING_high" for
interactions with high confidence (confidence scores>=700), and
"STRING_medium" for interactions with medium confidence (confidence
scores>=400). For undirect/physical interactions from Pathways Commons,
"PCommonsUN_high" indicates undirect interactions with high confidence
(supported with the PubMed references plus at least 2 different
sources), "PCommonsUN_medium" for undirect interactions with medium
confidence (supported with the PubMed references). For direct
(pathway-merged) interactions from Pathways Commons, "PCommonsDN_high"
indicates direct interactions with high confidence (supported with the
PubMed references plus at least 2 different sources), and
"PCommonsUN_medium" for direct interactions with medium confidence
(supported with the PubMed references). In addtion to pooled version of
pathways from all data sources, the user can also choose the
pathway-merged network from individual sources, that is,
"PCommonsDN_Reactome" for those from Reactome, "PCommonsDN_KEGG" for
those from KEGG, "PCommonsDN_HumanCyc" for those from HumanCyc,
"PCommonsDN_PID" for those froom PID, "PCommonsDN_PANTHER" for those
from PANTHER, "PCommonsDN_ReconX" for those from ReconX,
"PCommonsDN_TRANSFAC" for those from TRANSFAC, "PCommonsDN_PhosphoSite"
for those from PhosphoSite, and "PCommonsDN_CTD" for those from CTD}

\item{network.customised}{an object of class "igraph". By default, it
is NULL. It is designed to allow the user analysing their customised
network data that are not listed in the above argument 'network'. This
customisation (if provided) has the high priority over built-in
network}

\item{seed.genes}{logical to indicate whether the identified network is
restricted to seed genes (ie input genes with the signficant level). By
default, it sets to true}

\item{subnet.significance}{the given significance threshold. By
default, it is set to NULL, meaning there is no constraint on
nodes/genes. If given, those nodes/genes with p-values below this are
considered significant and thus scored positively. Instead, those
p-values above this given significance threshold are considered
insigificant and thus scored negatively}

\item{subnet.size}{the desired number of nodes constrained to the
resulting subnet. It is not nulll, a wide range of significance
thresholds will be scanned to find the optimal significance threshold
leading to the desired number of nodes in the resulting subnet.
Notably, the given significance threshold will be overwritten by this
option}

\item{verbose}{logical to indicate whether the messages will be
displayed in the screen. By default, it sets to true for display}

\item{RData.location}{the characters to tell the location of built-in
RData files. See \code{\link{xRDataLoader}} for details}

a subgraph with a maximum score, an object of class "igraph"
}
\description{
\code{xSubneterGenes} is supposed to identify maximum-scoring
subnetwork from an input graph with the node information on the
significance (measured as p-values or fdr). It returns an object of
class "igraph".
}
\note{
The algorithm identifying a subnetwork is implemented in the dnet
package
(http://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-014-0064-8).
In brief, from an input network with input node/gene information (the
significant level; p-values or FDR), the way of searching for a
maximum-scoring subnetwork is done as follows. Given the threshold of
tolerable p-value, it gives positive scores for nodes with p-values
below the threshold (nodes of interest), and negative scores for nodes
with threshold-above p-values (intolerable). After score
transformation, the search for a maximum scoring subnetwork is deduced
to find the connected subnetwork that is enriched with positive-score
nodes, allowing for a few negative-score nodes as linkers. This
objective is met through minimum spanning tree finding and
post-processing, previously used as a heuristic solver of
prize-collecting Steiner tree problem. The solver is deterministic,
only determined by the given tolerable p-value threshold. For
identification of the subnetwork with a desired number of nodes, an
iterative procedure is also developed to fine-tune tolerable
thresholds. This explicit control over the node size may be necessary
for guiding follow-up experiments.
