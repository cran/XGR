<h2>Function to identify a gene network from an input network given a list of genomic regions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>xGR2xNet</code> is supposed to identify maximum-scoring gene subnetwork
from an input graph with the node information (genomic regions with or
without the significance). To do so, it defines seed genes and their
scores that take into account the distance to and the significance of
input genomic regions (GR). It returns an object of class &quot;igraph&quot;.
</p>

</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a named input vector containing the significance level for
genomic regions (GR). For this named vector, the element names are GR,
in the format of 'chrN:start-end', where N is either 1-22 or X, start
(or end) is genomic positional number; for example, 'chr1:13-20', the
element values for the significance level (measured as p-value or fdr).
Alternatively, it can be a matrix or data frame with two columns: 1st
column for GR, 2nd column for the significance level. Also supported is
the input with GR only (without the significance level)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>significance.threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>the given significance threshold. By
default, it is set to NULL, meaning there is no constraint on the
significance level when transforming the significance level of GR into
scores. If given, those GR below this are considered significant and
thus scored positively. Instead, those above this are considered
insignificant and thus receive no score</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>score.cap</code></td>
<td>
<p>the maximum score being capped. By default, it is set
to NULL, meaning that no capping is applied</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>build.conversion</code></td>
<td>
<p>the conversion from one genome build to
another. The conversions supported are &quot;hg38.to.hg19&quot; and
&quot;hg18.to.hg19&quot;. By default it is NA (no need to do so)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>crosslink</code></td>
<td>
<p>the built-in crosslink info with a score quantifying
the link of a GR to a gene. See <code>xGR2xGenes</code> for details</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>crosslink.customised</code></td>
<td>
<p>the crosslink info with a score quantifying
the link of a GR to a gene. A user-input matrix or data frame with 4
columns: 1st column for genomic regions (formatted as &quot;chr:start-end&quot;,
genome build 19), 2nd column for Genes, 3rd for crosslink score
(crosslinking a genomic region to a gene, such as -log10 significance
level), and 4th for contexts (optional; if nor provided, it will be
added as 'C'). Alternatively, it can be a file containing these 4
columns. Required, otherwise it will return NULL</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cdf.function</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character specifying how to transform the input
crosslink score. It can be one of 'original' (no such transformation),
and 'empirical' for looking at empirical Cumulative Distribution
Function (cdf; as such it is converted into pvalue-like values [0,1])</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>scoring.scheme</code></td>
<td>
<p>the method used to calculate seed gene scores
under a set of GR (also over Contexts if many). It can be one of &quot;sum&quot;
for adding up, &quot;max&quot; for the maximum, and &quot;sequential&quot; for the
sequential weighting. The sequential weighting is done via:
<i>&sum;_{i=1}{\frac{R_{i}}{i}}</i>, where <i>R_{i}</i> is the
<i>i^{th}</i> rank (in a descreasing order)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nearby.distance.max</code></td>
<td>
<p>the maximum distance between genes and GR.
Only those genes no far way from this distance will be considered as
seed genes. This parameter will influence the distance-component
weights calculated for nearby GR per gene</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nearby.decay.kernel</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character specifying a decay kernel
function. It can be one of 'slow' for slow decay, 'linear' for linear
decay, and 'rapid' for rapid decay. If no distance weight is used,
please select 'constant'</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nearby.decay.exponent</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric specifying a decay exponent. By
default, it sets to 2</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>network</code></td>
<td>
<p>the built-in network. Currently two sources of network
information are supported: the STRING database (version 10) and the
Pathway Commons database (version 7). STRING is a meta-integration of
undirect interactions from the functional aspect, while Pathways
Commons mainly contains both undirect and direct interactions from the
physical/pathway aspect. Both have scores to control the confidence of
interactions. Therefore, the user can choose the different quality of
the interactions. In STRING, &quot;STRING_highest&quot; indicates interactions
with highest confidence (confidence scores&gt;=900), &quot;STRING_high&quot; for
interactions with high confidence (confidence scores&gt;=700),
&quot;STRING_medium&quot; for interactions with medium confidence (confidence
scores&gt;=400), and &quot;STRING_low&quot; for interactions with low confidence
(confidence scores&gt;=150). For undirect/physical interactions from
Pathways Commons, &quot;PCommonsUN_high&quot; indicates undirect interactions
with high confidence (supported with the PubMed references plus at
least 2 different sources), &quot;PCommonsUN_medium&quot; for undirect
interactions with medium confidence (supported with the PubMed
references). For direct (pathway-merged) interactions from Pathways
Commons, &quot;PCommonsDN_high&quot; indicates direct interactions with high
confidence (supported with the PubMed references plus at least 2
different sources), and &quot;PCommonsUN_medium&quot; for direct interactions
with medium confidence (supported with the PubMed references). In
addition to pooled version of pathways from all data sources, the user
can also choose the pathway-merged network from individual sources,
that is, &quot;PCommonsDN_Reactome&quot; for those from Reactome,
&quot;PCommonsDN_KEGG&quot; for those from KEGG, &quot;PCommonsDN_HumanCyc&quot; for those
from HumanCyc, &quot;PCommonsDN_PID&quot; for those froom PID,
&quot;PCommonsDN_PANTHER&quot; for those from PANTHER, &quot;PCommonsDN_ReconX&quot; for
those from ReconX, &quot;PCommonsDN_TRANSFAC&quot; for those from TRANSFAC,
&quot;PCommonsDN_PhosphoSite&quot; for those from PhosphoSite, and
&quot;PCommonsDN_CTD&quot; for those from CTD. For direct (pathway-merged)
interactions sourced from KEGG, it can be 'KEGG' for all,
'KEGG_metabolism' for pathways grouped into 'Metabolism',
'KEGG_genetic' for 'Genetic Information Processing' pathways,
'KEGG_environmental' for 'Environmental Information Processing'
pathways, 'KEGG_cellular' for 'Cellular Processes' pathways,
'KEGG_organismal' for 'Organismal Systems' pathways, and 'KEGG_disease'
for 'Human Diseases' pathways. 'REACTOME' for protein-protein
interactions derived from Reactome pathways</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>network.customised</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class &quot;igraph&quot;. By default, it
is NULL. It is designed to allow the user analysing their customised
network data that are not listed in the above argument 'network'. This
customisation (if provided) has the high priority over built-in
network</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>seed.genes</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the identified network is
restricted to seed genes (ie nearby genes that are located within
defined distance window centred on lead or LD SNPs). By default, it
sets to true</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>subnet.significance</code></td>
<td>
<p>the given significance threshold. By
default, it is set to NULL, meaning there is no constraint on
nodes/genes. If given, those nodes/genes with p-values below this are
considered significant and thus scored positively. Instead, those
p-values above this given significance threshold are considered
insigificant and thus scored negatively</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>subnet.size</code></td>
<td>
<p>the desired number of nodes constrained to the
resulting subnet. It is not nulll, a wide range of significance
thresholds will be scanned to find the optimal significance threshold
leading to the desired number of nodes in the resulting subnet.
Notably, the given significance threshold will be overwritten by this
option</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the messages will be
displayed in the screen. By default, it sets to true for display</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>RData.location</code></td>
<td>
<p>the characters to tell the location of built-in
RData files. See <code>xRDataLoader</code> for details</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a subgraph with a maximum score, an object of class &quot;igraph&quot;. It has
graph attributes (evidence, gp_evidence) and node attributes
(significance, score).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The algorithm identifying a gene subnetwork that is likely modulated by
input genomic regions (GR) includes two major steps. The first step is
to use <code>xGR2xGeneScores</code> for defining and scoring nearby
genes that are located within distance window of input GR. The second
step is to use <code>xSubneterGenes</code> for identifying a
maximum-scoring gene subnetwork that contains as many highly scored
genes as possible but a few less scored genes as linkers.
