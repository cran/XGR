<h2>Function to priorise genes from an input network and the weight info imposed on its nodes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>xPrioritiserGenes</code> is supposed to prioritise genes given an input
graph and a list of seed nodes. It implements Random Walk with Restart
(RWR) and calculates the affinity score of all nodes in the graph to
the seeds. The priority score is the affinity score. Parallel computing
is also supported for Linux or Mac operating systems. It returns an
object of class &quot;pNode&quot;.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
xPrioritiserGenes(data, network = c("STRING_highest", "STRING_high",
"STRING_medium", "PCommonsUN_high", "PCommonsUN_medium",
"PCommonsDN_high",
"PCommonsDN_medium", "PCommonsDN_Reactome", "PCommonsDN_KEGG",
"PCommonsDN_HumanCyc", "PCommonsDN_PID", "PCommonsDN_PANTHER",
"PCommonsDN_ReconX", "PCommonsDN_TRANSFAC", "PCommonsDN_PhosphoSite",
"PCommonsDN_CTD"), network.customised = NULL, normalise =
c("laplacian",
"row", "column", "none"), restart = 0.75,
normalise.affinity.matrix = c("none", "quantile"), parallel = TRUE,
multicores = NULL, verbose = T,
RData.location =
"https://github.com/hfang-bristol/RDataCentre/blob/master/XGR/1.0.0")
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a named input vector containing a list of seed nodes (ie
gene symbols). For this named vector, the element names are seed/node
names (e.g. gene symbols), the element (non-zero) values used to weight
the relative importance of seeds. Alternatively, it can be a matrix or
data frame with two columns: 1st column for seed/node names, 2nd column
for the weight values</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>network</code></td>
<td>
<p>the built-in network. Currently two sources of network
information are supported: the STRING database (version 10) and the
Pathways Commons database (version 7). STRING is a meta-integration of
undirect interactions from the functional aspect, while Pathways
Commons mainly contains both undirect and direct interactions from the
physical/pathway aspect. Both have scores to control the confidence of
interactions. Therefore, the user can choose the different quality of
the interactions. In STRING, &quot;STRING_highest&quot; indicates interactions
with highest confidence (confidence scores&gt;=900), &quot;STRING_high&quot; for
interactions with high confidence (confidence scores&gt;=700), and
&quot;STRING_medium&quot; for interactions with medium confidence (confidence
scores&gt;=400). For undirect/physical interactions from Pathways Commons,
&quot;PCommonsUN_high&quot; indicates undirect interactions with high confidence
(supported with the PubMed references plus at least 2 different
sources), &quot;PCommonsUN_medium&quot; for undirect interactions with medium
confidence (supported with the PubMed references). For direct
(pathway-merged) interactions from Pathways Commons, &quot;PCommonsDN_high&quot;
indicates direct interactions with high confidence (supported with the
PubMed references plus at least 2 different sources), and
&quot;PCommonsUN_medium&quot; for direct interactions with medium confidence
(supported with the PubMed references). In addtion to pooled version of
pathways from all data sources, the user can also choose the
pathway-merged network from individual sources, that is,
&quot;PCommonsDN_Reactome&quot; for those from Reactome, &quot;PCommonsDN_KEGG&quot; for
those from KEGG, &quot;PCommonsDN_HumanCyc&quot; for those from HumanCyc,
&quot;PCommonsDN_PID&quot; for those froom PID, &quot;PCommonsDN_PANTHER&quot; for those
from PANTHER, &quot;PCommonsDN_ReconX&quot; for those from ReconX,
&quot;PCommonsDN_TRANSFAC&quot; for those from TRANSFAC, &quot;PCommonsDN_PhosphoSite&quot;
for those from PhosphoSite, and &quot;PCommonsDN_CTD&quot; for those from CTD</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>network.customised</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class &quot;igraph&quot;. By default, it
is NULL. It is designed to allow the user analysing their customised
network data that are not listed in the above argument 'network'. This
customisation (if provided) has the high priority over built-in
network</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>normalise</code></td>
<td>
<p>the way to normalise the adjacency matrix of the input
graph. It can be 'laplacian' for laplacian normalisation, 'row' for
row-wise normalisation, 'column' for column-wise normalisation, or
'none'</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>restart</code></td>
<td>
<p>the restart probability used for Random Walk with
Restart (RWR). The restart probability takes the value from 0 to 1,
controlling the range from the starting nodes/seeds that the walker
will explore. The higher the value, the more likely the walker is to
visit the nodes centered on the starting nodes. At the extreme when the
restart probability is zero, the walker moves freely to the neighbors
at each step without restarting from seeds, i.e., following a random
walk (RW)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>normalise.affinity.matrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>the way to normalise the output
affinity matrix. It can be 'none' for no normalisation, 'quantile' for
quantile normalisation to ensure that columns (if multiple) of the
output affinity matrix have the same quantiles</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>parallel</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether parallel computation with
multicores is used. By default, it sets to true, but not necessarily
does so. Partly because parallel backends available will be
system-specific (now only Linux or Mac OS). Also, it will depend on
whether these two packages &quot;foreach&quot; and &quot;doMC&quot; have been installed. It
can be installed via:
<code>source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R");
biocLite(c("foreach","doMC"))</code>. If not yet installed, this option will
be disabled</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>multicores</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer to specify how many cores will be
registered as the multicore parallel backend to the 'foreach' package.
If NULL, it will use a half of cores available in a user's computer.
This option only works when parallel computation is enabled</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the messages will be
displayed in the screen. By default, it sets to true for display</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>RData.location</code></td>
<td>
<p>the characters to tell the location of built-in
RData files. See <code>xRDataLoader</code> for details</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an object of class &quot;pNode&quot;, a list with following components:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>priority</code>: a matrix of nNode X 4 containing node priority
information, where nNode is the number of nodes in the input graph, and
the 4 columns are &quot;name&quot; (node names), &quot;seed&quot; (1 for seeds, 0 for
non-seeds), &quot;weight&quot; (weight values), &quot;priority&quot; (the priority scores
that are rescaled to the range [0,1]), &quot;rank&quot; (ranks of the priority
scores)

</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The input graph will treat as an unweighted graph if there is no
