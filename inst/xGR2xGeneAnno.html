<h2>Function to conduct region-based enrichment analysis via crosslinked genes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>xGR2xGeneAnno</code> is supposed to conduct region-based enrichment
analysis for the input genomic region data (genome build h19), using
crosslinked gene annotations. To do so, crosslinked genes are first
defined. Currently supported built-in crosslink info is enhancer genes,
eQTL genes, conformation genes and nearby genes (purely), though the
user can customise it via 'crosslink.customised'; if so, it has
priority over the built-in data. Enrichment analysis is then based on
either Fisher's exact test or Hypergeometric test for estimating the
significance of overlapped crosslinked genes. Test background can be
provided; by default, the annotatable genes will be used.
</p>

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>input genomic regions (GR). If formatted as &quot;chr:start-end&quot;
(see the next parameter 'format' below), GR should be provided as a
vector in the format of 'chrN:start-end', where N is either 1-22 or X,
start (or end) is genomic positional number; for example, 'chr1:13-20'.
If formatted as a 'data.frame', the first three columns correspond to
the chromosome (1st column), the starting chromosome position (2nd
column), and the ending chromosome position (3rd column). If the format
is indicated as 'bed' (browser extensible data), the same as
'data.frame' format but the position is 0-based offset from chromomose
position. If the genomic regions provided are not ranged but only the
single position, the ending chromosome position (3rd column) is allowed
not to be provided. The data could also be an object of 'GRanges' (in
this case, formatted as 'GRanges')</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>background</code></td>
<td>
<p>an input background containing a list of genomic
regions as the test background. The file format is the same as 'data'
above. By default, it is NULL meaning all annotatable genes are used as
background</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>format</code></td>
<td>
<p>the format of the input data. It can be one of
&quot;data.frame&quot;, &quot;chr:start-end&quot;, &quot;bed&quot; or &quot;GRanges&quot;</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>build.conversion</code></td>
<td>
<p>the conversion from one genome build to
another. The conversions supported are &quot;hg38.to.hg19&quot; and
&quot;hg18.to.hg19&quot;. By default it is NA (no need to do so)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>crosslink</code></td>
<td>
<p>the built-in crosslink info with a score quantifying
the link of a GR to a gene. See <code>xGR2xGenes</code> for details</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>crosslink.customised</code></td>
<td>
<p>the crosslink info with a score quantifying
the link of a GR to a gene. A user-input matrix or data frame with 4
columns: 1st column for genomic regions (formatted as &quot;chr:start-end&quot;,
genome build 19), 2nd column for Genes, 3rd for crosslink score
(crosslinking a genomic region to a gene, such as -log10 significance
level), and 4th for contexts (optional; if not provided, it will be
added as 'C'). Alternatively, it can be a file containing these 4
columns. Required, otherwise it will return NULL</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>crosslink.top</code></td>
<td>
<p>the number of the top genes defined by 'data' will
be used for test. By default, it is NULL</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nearby.distance.max</code></td>
<td>
<p>the maximum distance between genes and GR.
Only those genes no far way from this distance will be considered as
seed genes. This parameter will influence the distance-component
weights calculated for nearby GR per gene</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nearby.decay.kernel</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character specifying a decay kernel
function. It can be one of 'slow' for slow decay, 'linear' for linear
decay, and 'rapid' for rapid decay. If no distance weight is used,
please select 'constant'</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nearby.decay.exponent</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric specifying a decay exponent. By
default, it sets to 2</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ontology</code></td>
<td>
<p>the ontology supported currently. By default, it is
'NA' to disable this option. Pre-built ontology and annotation data are
detailed in <code>xDefineOntology</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>size.range</code></td>
<td>
<p>the minimum and maximum size of members of each term
in consideration. By default, it sets to a minimum of 10 but no more
than 2000</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>min.overlap</code></td>
<td>
<p>the minimum number of overlaps. Only those terms
with members that overlap with input data at least min.overlap (3 by
default) will be processed</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>which.distance</code></td>
<td>
<p>which terms with the distance away from the
ontology root (if any) is used to restrict terms in consideration. By
default, it sets to 'NULL' to consider all distances</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>test</code></td>
<td>
<p>the test statistic used. It can be &quot;fisher&quot; for using
fisher's exact test, &quot;hypergeo&quot; for using hypergeometric test, or
&quot;binomial&quot; for using binomial test. Fisher's exact test is to test the
independence between gene group (genes belonging to a group or not) and
gene annotation (genes annotated by a term or not), and thus compare
sampling to the left part of background (after sampling without
replacement). Hypergeometric test is to sample at random (without
replacement) from the background containing annotated and non-annotated
genes, and thus compare sampling to background. Unlike hypergeometric
test, binomial test is to sample at random (with replacement) from the
background with the constant probability. In terms of the ease of
finding the significance, they are in order: hypergeometric test &gt;
fisher's exact test &gt; binomial test. In other words, in terms of the
calculated p-value, hypergeometric test &lt; fisher's exact test &lt;
binomial test</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>background.annotatable.only</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the
background is further restricted to the annotatable. By default, it is
NULL: if ontology.algorithm is not 'none', it is always TRUE;
otherwise, it depends on the background (if not provided, it will be
TRUE; otherwise FALSE). Surely, it can be explicitly stated</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>p.tail</code></td>
<td>
<p>the tail used to calculate p-values. It can be either
&quot;two-tails&quot; for the significance based on two-tails (ie both over- and
under-overrepresentation) or &quot;one-tail&quot; (by default) for the
significance based on one tail (ie only over-representation)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>p.adjust.method</code></td>
<td>
<p>the method used to adjust p-values. It can be
one of &quot;BH&quot;, &quot;BY&quot;, &quot;bonferroni&quot;, &quot;holm&quot;, &quot;hochberg&quot; and &quot;hommel&quot;. The
first two methods &quot;BH&quot; (widely used) and &quot;BY&quot; control the false
discovery rate (FDR: the expected proportion of false discoveries
amongst the rejected hypotheses); the last four methods &quot;bonferroni&quot;,
&quot;holm&quot;, &quot;hochberg&quot; and &quot;hommel&quot; are designed to give strong control of
the family-wise error rate (FWER). Notes: FDR is a less stringent
condition than FWER</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ontology.algorithm</code></td>
<td>
<p>the algorithm used to account for the
hierarchy of the ontology. It can be one of &quot;none&quot;, &quot;pc&quot;, &quot;elim&quot; and

<tr valign="top"><td><code>elim.pvalue</code></td>
<td>
<p>the parameter only used when &quot;ontology.algorithm&quot; is
&quot;elim&quot;. It is used to control how to declare a signficantly enriched
term (and subsequently all genes in this term are eliminated from all
its ancestors)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>lea.depth</code></td>
<td>
<p>the parameter only used when &quot;ontology.algorithm&quot; is
&quot;lea&quot;. It is used to control how many maximum depth is used to consider
the children of a term (and subsequently all genes in these children
term are eliminated from the use for the recalculation of the
signifance at this term)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>path.mode</code></td>
<td>
<p>the mode of paths induced by vertices/nodes with input
annotation data. It can be &quot;all_paths&quot; for all possible paths to the
root, &quot;shortest_paths&quot; for only one path to the root (for each node in
query), &quot;all_shortest_paths&quot; for all shortest paths to the root (i.e.
for each node, find all shortest paths with the equal lengths)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>true.path.rule</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the true-path rule
should be applied to propagate annotations. By default, it sets to
false</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>out.evidence</code></td>

output. By default, it sets to true</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The interpretation of the algorithms used to account for the hierarchy
of the ontology is:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;none&quot;: does not consider the ontology hierarchy at all.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;lea&quot;: computers the significance of a term in terms of the
significance of its children at the maximum depth (e.g. 2). Precisely,
once snps are already annotated to any children terms with a more
signficance than itself, then all these snps are eliminated from the
use for the recalculation of the signifance at that term. The final
p-values takes the maximum of the original p-value and the recalculated
p-value.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;elim&quot;: computers the significance of a term in terms of the
significance of its all children. Precisely, once snps are already
annotated to a signficantly enriched term under the cutoff of e.g.
pvalue&lt;1e-2, all these snps are eliminated from the ancestors of that
term).
</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;pc&quot;: requires the significance of a term not only using the
whole snps as background but also using snps annotated to all its
direct parents/ancestors as background. The final p-value takes the
maximum of both p-values in these two calculations.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;Notes&quot;: the order of the number of significant terms is: &quot;none&quot;
&gt; &quot;lea&quot; &gt; &quot;elim&quot; &gt; &quot;pc&quot;.
</p>
</li></ul>
