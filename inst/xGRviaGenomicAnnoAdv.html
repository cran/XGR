<h2>Function to conduct region-based enrichment analysis using genomic annotations via sampling</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>xGRviaGenomicAnnoAdv</code> is supposed to conduct region-based
enrichment analysis for the input genomic region data (genome build
h19), using genomic annotations (eg active chromatin, transcription
factor binding sites/motifs, conserved sites). Enrichment analysis is
achieved by comparing the observed overlaps against the expected
overlaps which are estimated from the null distribution. The null
distribution is generated via sampling, that is, randomly generating
samples for data genomic regions from background genomic regions.
Background genomic regions can be provided by the user; by default, the
annotatable genomic regions will be used.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
xGRviaGenomicAnnoAdv(
data.file,
annotation.file = NULL,
background.file = NULL,
format.file = c("data.frame", "bed", "chr:start-end", "GRanges"),
build.conversion = c(NA, "hg38.to.hg19", "hg18.to.hg19"),
background.annotatable.only = F,
num.samples = 1000,
gap.max = 50000,
max.distance = NULL,
p.adjust.method = c("BH", "BY", "bonferroni", "holm", "hochberg",
"hommel"),
GR.annotation = NA,
parallel = TRUE,
multicores = NULL,
verbose = T,
RData.location = "http://galahad.well.ox.ac.uk/bigdata",
guid = NULL
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data.file</code></td>
<td>
<p>an input data file, containing a list of genomic
regions to test. If the input file is formatted as a 'data.frame'
(specified by the parameter 'format.file' below), the first three
columns correspond to the chromosome (1st column), the starting
chromosome position (2nd column), and the ending chromosome position
(3rd column). If the format is indicated as 'bed' (browser extensible
data), the same as 'data.frame' format but the position is 0-based
offset from chromomose position. If the genomic regions provided are
not ranged but only the single position, the ending chromosome position
(3rd column) is allowed not to be provided. If the format is indicated
as &quot;chr:start-end&quot;, instead of using the first 3 columns, only the
first column will be used and processed. If the file also contains
other columns, these additional columns will be ignored. Alternatively,
the input file can be the content itself assuming that input file has
been read. Note: the file should use the tab delimiter as the field
separator between columns.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>annotation.file</code></td>
<td>
<p>an input annotation file containing genomic
annotations for genomic regions. If the input file is formatted as a
'data.frame', the first four columns correspond to the chromosome (1st
column), the starting chromosome position (2nd column), the ending
chromosome position (3rd column), and the genomic annotations (eg
transcription factors and histones; 4th column). If the format is
indicated as 'bed', the same as 'data.frame' format but the position is
0-based offset from chromomose position. If the format is indicated as
&quot;chr:start-end&quot;, the first two columns correspond to the
chromosome:start-end (1st column) and the genomic annotations (eg
transcription factors and histones; 2nd column). If the file also
contains other columns, these additional columns will be ignored.
Alternatively, the input file can be the content itself assuming that
input file has been read. Note: the file should use the tab delimiter
as the field separator between columns.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>background.file</code></td>
<td>
<p>an input background file containing a list of
genomic regions as the test background. The file format is the same as
'data.file'. By default, it is NULL meaning all annotatable bases (ig
non-redundant bases covered by 'annotation.file') are used as
background. However, if only one annotation (eg only a transcription
factor) is provided in 'annotation.file', the background must be
provided.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>format.file</code></td>
<td>
<p>the format for input files. It can be one of
&quot;data.frame&quot;, &quot;chr:start-end&quot;, &quot;bed&quot; and &quot;GRanges&quot;</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>build.conversion</code></td>
<td>
<p>the conversion from one genome build to
another. The conversions supported are &quot;hg38.to.hg19&quot; and
&quot;hg18.to.hg19&quot;. By default it is NA (no need to do so).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>background.annotatable.only</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the
background is further restricted to annotatable bases (covered by
'annotation.file'). In other words, if the background is provided, the
background bases are those after being overlapped with annotatable
bases. Notably, if only one annotation (eg only a transcription factor)
is provided in 'annotation.file', it should be false.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>num.samples</code></td>
<td>
<p>the number of samples randomly generated</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>gap.max</code></td>
<td>
<p>the maximum distance of background islands to be
considered away from data regions. Only background islands no far way
from this distance will be considered. For example, if it is 0, meaning
that only background islands that overlapp with genomic regions will be
considered. By default, it is 50000</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>max.distance</code></td>
<td>
<p>the maximum distance away from data regions that is
allowed when generating random samples. By default, it is NULl meaning
no such restriction</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>p.adjust.method</code></td>
<td>
<p>the method used to adjust p-values. It can be
one of &quot;BH&quot;, &quot;BY&quot;, &quot;bonferroni&quot;, &quot;holm&quot;, &quot;hochberg&quot; and &quot;hommel&quot;. The
first two methods &quot;BH&quot; (widely used) and &quot;BY&quot; control the false
discovery rate (FDR: the expected proportion of false discoveries
amongst the rejected hypotheses); the last four methods &quot;bonferroni&quot;,
&quot;holm&quot;, &quot;hochberg&quot; and &quot;hommel&quot; are designed to give strong control of
the family-wise error rate (FWER). Notes: FDR is a less stringent
condition than FWER</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>GR.annotation</code></td>
<td>
<p>the genomic regions of annotation data. By
default, it is 'NA' to disable this option. Pre-built genomic
annotation data are detailed in <code>xDefineGenomicAnno</code>.
Alternatively, the user can also directly provide a customised GR
object (or a list of GR objects)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>parallel</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether parallel computation with
multicores is used. By default, it sets to true, but not necessarily
does so. It will depend on whether these two packages &quot;foreach&quot; and
&quot;doParallel&quot; have been installed</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>multicores</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer to specify how many cores will be
registered as the multicore parallel backend to the 'foreach' package.
If NULL, it will use a half of cores available in a user's computer.
This option only works when parallel computation is enabled</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the messages will be
displayed in the screen. By default, it sets to false for no display</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>RData.location</code></td>
<td>
<p>the characters to tell the location of built-in
RData files. See <code>xRDataLoader</code> for details</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>guid</code></td>
<td>
<p>a valid (5-character) Global Unique IDentifier for an OSF
project. See <code>xRDataLoader</code> for details</p>
</td></tr>
