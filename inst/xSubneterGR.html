<h2>Function to identify a gene network from an input network given a list of genomic regions together with the significance level</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>xSubneterGR</code> is supposed to identify maximum-scoring gene
subnetwork from an input graph with the node information on the
significance (measured as p-values or fdr). To do so, it defines seed
genes and their scores that take into account the distance to and the
significance of input genomic regions (GR). It returns an object of
class &quot;igraph&quot;.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
xSubneterGR(data, significance.threshold = 5e-05, score.cap = 10,
build.conversion = c(NA, "hg38.to.hg19", "hg18.to.hg19"),
distance.max = 50000, decay.kernel = c("slow", "linear", "rapid",
"constant"), decay.exponent = 2, GR.Gene = c("UCSC_knownGene",
"UCSC_knownCanonical"), scoring.scheme = c("max", "sum", "sequential"),

</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a named input vector containing the sinificance level for
genomic regions (GR). For this named vector, the element names are GR,
in the format of 'chrN:start-end', where N is either 1-22 or X, start
(or end) is genomic positional number; for example, 'chr1:13-20'. The
element values for the significance level (measured as p-value or fdr).
Alternatively, it can be a matrix or data frame with two columns: 1st
column for GR, 2nd column for the significance level.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>significance.threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>the given significance threshold. By
default, it is set to NULL, meaning there is no constraint on the
significance level when transforming the significance level of GR into
scores. If given, those GR below this are considered significant and
thus scored positively. Instead, those above this are considered
insigificant and thus receive no score</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>score.cap</code></td>
<td>
<p>the maximum score being capped. By default, it is set
to 10. If NULL, no capping is applied</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>build.conversion</code></td>
<td>
<p>the conversion from one genome build to
another. The conversions supported are &quot;hg38.to.hg19&quot; and
&quot;hg18.to.hg19&quot;. By default it is NA (no need to do so)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>distance.max</code></td>
<td>
<p>the maximum distance between genes and GR. Only
those genes no far way from this distance will be considered as seed
genes. This parameter will influence the distance-component weights
calculated for nearby GR per gene</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>decay.kernel</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character specifying a decay kernel function. It
can be one of 'slow' for slow decay, 'linear' for linear decay, and
'rapid' for rapid decay. If no distance weight is used, please select
'constant'</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>decay.exponent</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric specifying a decay exponent. By
default, it sets to 2</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>GR.Gene</code></td>
<td>
<p>the genomic regions of genes. By default, it is
'UCSC_knownGene', that is, UCSC known genes (together with genomic
locations) based on human genome assembly hg19. It can be
'UCSC_knownCanonical', that is, UCSC known canonical genes (together
with genomic locations) based on human genome assembly hg19.
Alternatively, the user can specify the customised input. To do so,
first save your RData file (containing an GR object) into your local
computer, and make sure the GR object content names refer to Gene
Symbols. Then, tell &quot;GR.Gene&quot; with your RData file name (with or
without extension), plus specify your file RData path in
&quot;RData.location&quot;. Note: you can also load your customised GR object
directly</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>scoring.scheme</code></td>
<td>
<p>the method used to calculate seed gene scores
under a set of GR. It can be one of &quot;sum&quot; for adding up, &quot;max&quot; for the
maximum, and &quot;sequential&quot; for the sequential weighting. The sequential
weighting is done via: <i>&sum;_{i=1}{\frac{R_{i}}{i}}</i>, where
<i>R_{i}</i> is the <i>i^{th}</i> rank (in a descreasing order)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>network</code></td>
<td>
<p>the built-in network. Currently two sources of network
information are supported: the STRING database (version 10) and the
Pathway Commons database (version 7). STRING is a meta-integration of
undirect interactions from the functional aspect, while Pathways
Commons mainly contains both undirect and direct interactions from the
physical/pathway aspect. Both have scores to control the confidence of
interactions. Therefore, the user can choose the different quality of
the interactions. In STRING, &quot;STRING_highest&quot; indicates interactions
with highest confidence (confidence scores&gt;=900), &quot;STRING_high&quot; for
interactions with high confidence (confidence scores&gt;=700),
&quot;STRING_medium&quot; for interactions with medium confidence (confidence
scores&gt;=400), and &quot;STRING_low&quot; for interactions with low confidence
(confidence scores&gt;=150). For undirect/physical interactions from
Pathways Commons, &quot;PCommonsUN_high&quot; indicates undirect interactions
with high confidence (supported with the PubMed references plus at
least 2 different sources), &quot;PCommonsUN_medium&quot; for undirect
interactions with medium confidence (supported with the PubMed
references). For direct (pathway-merged) interactions from Pathways
Commons, &quot;PCommonsDN_high&quot; indicates direct interactions with high
confidence (supported with the PubMed references plus at least 2
different sources), and &quot;PCommonsUN_medium&quot; for direct interactions
with medium confidence (supported with the PubMed references). In
addition to pooled version of pathways from all data sources, the user
can also choose the pathway-merged network from individual sources,
that is, &quot;PCommonsDN_Reactome&quot; for those from Reactome,
&quot;PCommonsDN_KEGG&quot; for those from KEGG, &quot;PCommonsDN_HumanCyc&quot; for those
from HumanCyc, &quot;PCommonsDN_PID&quot; for those froom PID,
&quot;PCommonsDN_PANTHER&quot; for those from PANTHER, &quot;PCommonsDN_ReconX&quot; for
those from ReconX, &quot;PCommonsDN_TRANSFAC&quot; for those from TRANSFAC,
&quot;PCommonsDN_PhosphoSite&quot; for those from PhosphoSite, and
&quot;PCommonsDN_CTD&quot; for those from CTD. For direct (pathway-merged)
interactions sourced from KEGG, it can be 'KEGG' for all,
'KEGG_metabolism' for pathways grouped into 'Metabolism',
'KEGG_genetic' for 'Genetic Information Processing' pathways,
'KEGG_environmental' for 'Environmental Information Processing'
pathways, 'KEGG_cellular' for 'Cellular Processes' pathways,
'KEGG_organismal' for 'Organismal Systems' pathways, and 'KEGG_disease'
for 'Human Diseases' pathways. 'REACTOME' for protein-protein
interactions derived from Reactome pathways</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>network.customised</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class &quot;igraph&quot;. By default, it
is NULL. It is designed to allow the user analysing their customised
network data that are not listed in the above argument 'network'. This
customisation (if provided) has the high priority over built-in
network</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>seed.genes</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the identified network is
restricted to seed genes (ie nearby genes that are located within
defined distance window centred on lead or LD SNPs). By default, it
sets to true</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>subnet.significance</code></td>
<td>
<p>the given significance threshold. By
default, it is set to NULL, meaning there is no constraint on
nodes/genes. If given, those nodes/genes with p-values below this are
considered significant and thus scored positively. Instead, those
p-values above this given significance threshold are considered
insigificant and thus scored negatively</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>subnet.size</code></td>
<td>
<p>the desired number of nodes constrained to the
resulting subnet. It is not nulll, a wide range of significance
thresholds will be scanned to find the optimal significance threshold
leading to the desired number of nodes in the resulting subnet.
Notably, the given significance threshold will be overwritten by this
option</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the messages will be
displayed in the screen. By default, it sets to true for display</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>RData.location</code></td>
<td>
<p>the characters to tell the location of built-in
RData files. See <code>xRDataLoader</code> for details</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a subgraph with a maximum score, an object of class &quot;igraph&quot;. It has
ndoe attributes: significance, score, type
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The algorithm identifying a gene subnetwork that is likely modulated by
input genomic regions (GR) includes two major steps. The first step is
to use <code>xGR2GeneScores</code> for defining and scoring nearby
genes that are located within distance window of input GR. The second
step is to use <code>xSubneterGenes</code> for identifying a
maximum-scoring gene subnetwork that contains as many highly scored
genes as possible but a few less scored genes as linkers.
