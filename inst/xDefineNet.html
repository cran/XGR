<h2>Function to define a gene network</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>xDefineNet</code> is supposed to define a gene network sourced from the
STRING database or the Pathway Commons database. It returns an object
of class &quot;igraph&quot;.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
xDefineNet(network = c("STRING_highest", "STRING_high",
"STRING_medium",
"STRING_low", "PCommonsUN_high", "PCommonsUN_medium",
"PCommonsDN_high",
"PCommonsDN_medium", "PCommonsDN_Reactome", "PCommonsDN_KEGG",
"PCommonsDN_HumanCyc", "PCommonsDN_PID", "PCommonsDN_PANTHER",
"PCommonsDN_ReconX", "PCommonsDN_TRANSFAC", "PCommonsDN_PhosphoSite",
"PCommonsDN_CTD", "KEGG", "KEGG_metabolism", "KEGG_genetic",
"KEGG_environmental", "KEGG_cellular", "KEGG_organismal",
"KEGG_disease"),
STRING.only = c(NA, "neighborhood_score", "fusion_score",
"cooccurence_score", "coexpression_score", "experimental_score",
"database_score", "textmining_score")[1], weighted = FALSE,
verbose = TRUE, RData.location =
"http://galahad.well.ox.ac.uk/bigdata")
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>network</code></td>
<td>
<p>the built-in network. Currently two sources of network
information are supported: the STRING database (version 10) and the
Pathway Commons database (version 7). STRING is a meta-integration of
undirect interactions from the functional aspect, while Pathways
Commons mainly contains both undirect and direct interactions from the
physical/pathway aspect. Both have scores to control the confidence of
interactions. Therefore, the user can choose the different quality of
the interactions. In STRING, &quot;STRING_highest&quot; indicates interactions
with highest confidence (confidence scores&gt;=900), &quot;STRING_high&quot; for
interactions with high confidence (confidence scores&gt;=700),
&quot;STRING_medium&quot; for interactions with medium confidence (confidence
scores&gt;=400), and &quot;STRING_low&quot; for interactions with low confidence
(confidence scores&gt;=150). For undirect/physical interactions from
Pathways Commons, &quot;PCommonsUN_high&quot; indicates undirect interactions
with high confidence (supported with the PubMed references plus at
least 2 different sources), &quot;PCommonsUN_medium&quot; for undirect
interactions with medium confidence (supported with the PubMed
references). For direct (pathway-merged) interactions from Pathways
Commons, &quot;PCommonsDN_high&quot; indicates direct interactions with high
confidence (supported with the PubMed references plus at least 2
different sources), and &quot;PCommonsUN_medium&quot; for direct interactions
with medium confidence (supported with the PubMed references). In
addition to pooled version of pathways from all data sources, the user
can also choose the pathway-merged network from individual sources,
that is, &quot;PCommonsDN_Reactome&quot; for those from Reactome,
&quot;PCommonsDN_KEGG&quot; for those from KEGG, &quot;PCommonsDN_HumanCyc&quot; for those
from HumanCyc, &quot;PCommonsDN_PID&quot; for those froom PID,
&quot;PCommonsDN_PANTHER&quot; for those from PANTHER, &quot;PCommonsDN_ReconX&quot; for
those from ReconX, &quot;PCommonsDN_TRANSFAC&quot; for those from TRANSFAC,
&quot;PCommonsDN_PhosphoSite&quot; for those from PhosphoSite, and
&quot;PCommonsDN_CTD&quot; for those from CTD. For direct (pathway-merged)
interactions sourced from KEGG, it can be 'KEGG' for all,
'KEGG_metabolism' for pathways grouped into 'Metabolism',
'KEGG_genetic' for 'Genetic Information Processing' pathways,
'KEGG_environmental' for 'Environmental Information Processing'
pathways, 'KEGG_cellular' for 'Cellular Processes' pathways,
'KEGG_organismal' for 'Organismal Systems' pathways, and 'KEGG_disease'
for 'Human Diseases' pathways</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>STRING.only</code></td>
<td>
<p>the further restriction of STRING by interaction
type. If NA, no such restriction. Otherwide, it can be one or more of
&quot;neighborhood_score&quot;,&quot;fusion_score&quot;,&quot;cooccurence_score&quot;,&quot;coexpression_score&quot;,&quot;experimental_score&quot;,&quot;database_score&quot;,&quot;textmining_score&quot;.
Useful options are c(&quot;experimental_score&quot;,&quot;database_score&quot;): only
experimental data (extracted from BIND, DIP, GRID, HPRD, IntAct, MINT,
and PID) and curated data (extracted from Biocarta, BioCyc, GO, KEGG,
and Reactome) are used</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>weighted</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether edge weights should be
considered. By default, it sets to false. If true, it only works for
the network from the STRING database</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the messages will be
displayed in the screen. By default, it sets to true for display</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>RData.location</code></td>
<td>
<p>the characters to tell the location of built-in
RData files. See <code>xRDataLoader</code> for details</p>
</td></tr>
