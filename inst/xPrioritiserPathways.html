<h2>Function to prioritise pathways based on enrichment analysis of top prioritised genes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>xPrioritiserPathways</code> is supposed to prioritise pathways given
prioritised genes and the ontology in query. It returns an object of
class &quot;eTerm&quot;. It is done via enrichment analysis.

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pNode</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class &quot;pNode&quot;</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>priority.top</code></td>
<td>
<p>the number of the top targets to be analysed for
pathway enrichment</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>background</code></td>
<td>
<p>a background vector. It contains a list of Gene
Symbols as the test background. If NULL, by default all annotatable are
used as background</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ontology</code></td>
<td>
<p>the ontology supported currently. It can be &quot;GOBP&quot; for
Gene Ontology Biological Process, &quot;GOMF&quot; for Gene Ontology Molecular
Function, &quot;GOCC&quot; for Gene Ontology Cellular Component, &quot;PS&quot; for
phylostratific age information, &quot;PS2&quot; for the collapsed PS version
(inferred ancestors being collapsed into one with the known taxonomy
information), &quot;SF&quot; for domain superfamily assignments, &quot;DO&quot; for Disease
Ontology, &quot;HPPA&quot; for Human Phenotype Phenotypic Abnormality, &quot;HPMI&quot; for
Human Phenotype Mode of Inheritance, &quot;HPCM&quot; for Human Phenotype
Clinical Modifier, &quot;HPMA&quot; for Human Phenotype Mortality Aging, &quot;MP&quot; for
Mammalian Phenotype, and Drug-Gene Interaction database (DGIdb) for
drugable categories, and the molecular signatures database (Msigdb,
including &quot;MsigdbH&quot;, &quot;MsigdbC1&quot;, &quot;MsigdbC2CGP&quot;, &quot;MsigdbC2CPall&quot;,
&quot;MsigdbC2CP&quot;, &quot;MsigdbC2KEGG&quot;, &quot;MsigdbC2REACTOME&quot;, &quot;MsigdbC2BIOCARTA&quot;,

</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>size.range</code></td>
<td>
<p>the minimum and maximum size of members of each term
in consideration. By default, it sets to a minimum of 10 but no more
than 2000</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>min.overlap</code></td>
<td>
<p>the minimum number of overlaps. Only those terms
with members that overlap with input data at least min.overlap (3 by
default) will be processed</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>which.distance</code></td>
<td>
<p>which terms with the distance away from the
ontology root (if any) is used to restrict terms in consideration. By
default, it sets to 'NULL' to consider all distances</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>test</code></td>
<td>
<p>the statistic test used. It can be &quot;fisher&quot; for using
fisher's exact test, &quot;hypergeo&quot; for using hypergeometric test, or
&quot;binomial&quot; for using binomial test. Fisher's exact test is to test the
independence between gene group (genes belonging to a group or not) and
gene annotation (genes annotated by a term or not), and thus compare
sampling to the left part of background (after sampling without
replacement). Hypergeometric test is to sample at random (without
replacement) from the background containing annotated and non-annotated
genes, and thus compare sampling to background. Unlike hypergeometric
test, binomial test is to sample at random (with replacement) from the
background with the constant probability. In terms of the ease of
finding the significance, they are in order: hypergeometric test &gt;
binomial test &gt; fisher's exact test. In other words, in terms of the
calculated p-value, hypergeometric test &lt; binomial test &lt; fisher's
exact test</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>p.adjust.method</code></td>
<td>
<p>the method used to adjust p-values. It can be
one of &quot;BH&quot;, &quot;BY&quot;, &quot;bonferroni&quot;, &quot;holm&quot;, &quot;hochberg&quot; and &quot;hommel&quot;. The
first two methods &quot;BH&quot; (widely used) and &quot;BY&quot; control the false
discovery rate (FDR: the expected proportion of false discoveries
amongst the rejected hypotheses); the last four methods &quot;bonferroni&quot;,
&quot;holm&quot;, &quot;hochberg&quot; and &quot;hommel&quot; are designed to give strong control of
the family-wise error rate (FWER). Notes: FDR is a less stringent
condition than FWER</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ontology.algorithm</code></td>
<td>
<p>the algorithm used to account for the
hierarchy of the ontology. It can be one of &quot;none&quot;, &quot;pc&quot;, &quot;elim&quot; and

</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>elim.pvalue</code></td>
<td>
<p>the parameter only used when &quot;ontology.algorithm&quot; is
&quot;elim&quot;. It is used to control how to declare a signficantly enriched
term (and subsequently all genes in this term are eliminated from all
its ancestors)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>lea.depth</code></td>
<td>
<p>the parameter only used when &quot;ontology.algorithm&quot; is
&quot;lea&quot;. It is used to control how many maximum depth is used to consider

term are eliminated from the use for the recalculation of the
signifance at this term)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>path.mode</code></td>
<td>
<p>the mode of paths induced by vertices/nodes with input
annotation data. It can be &quot;all_paths&quot; for all possible paths to the
root, &quot;shortest_paths&quot; for only one path to the root (for each node in
query), &quot;all_shortest_paths&quot; for all shortest paths to the root (i.e.
for each node, find all shortest paths with the equal lengths)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>true.path.rule</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the true-path rule
should be applied to propagate annotations. By default, it sets to
false</p>

<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the messages will be
displayed in the screen. By default, it sets to false for no display</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an object of class &quot;eTerm&quot;, a list with following components:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>term_info</code>: a matrix of nTerm X 4 containing snp/gene set
information, where nTerm is the number of terms, and the 4 columns are
&quot;id&quot; (i.e. &quot;Term ID&quot;), &quot;name&quot; (i.e. &quot;Term Name&quot;), &quot;namespace&quot; and
&quot;distance&quot;
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>annotation</code>: a list of terms containing annotations, each
term storing its annotations. Always, terms are identified by &quot;id&quot;
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>data</code>: a vector containing input data in consideration. It
is not always the same as the input data as only those mappable are
retained
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>background</code>: a vector containing the background data. It is
not always the same as the input data as only those mappable are
retained
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>overlap</code>: a list of overlapped snp/gene sets, each storing
snps overlapped between a snp/gene set and the given input data (i.e.
the snps of interest). Always, gene sets are identified by &quot;id&quot;
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>zscore</code>: a vector containing z-scores
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>pvalue</code>: a vector containing p-values
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>adjp</code>: a vector containing adjusted p-values. It is the p
value but after being adjusted for multiple comparisons
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>call</code>: the call that produced this result
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The interpretation of the algorithms used to account for the hierarchy
of the ontology is:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;none&quot;: does not consider the ontology hierarchy at all.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;lea&quot;: computers the significance of a term in terms of the
significance of its children at the maximum depth (e.g. 2). Precisely,
once snps are already annotated to any children terms with a more
signficance than itself, then all these snps are eliminated from the
use for the recalculation of the signifance at that term. The final
p-values takes the maximum of the original p-value and the recalculated
p-value.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;elim&quot;: computers the significance of a term in terms of the
significance of its all children. Precisely, once snps are already
annotated to a signficantly enriched term under the cutoff of e.g.
pvalue&lt;1e-2, all these snps are eliminated from the ancestors of that
term).
</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;pc&quot;: requires the significance of a term not only using the
whole snps as background but also using snps annotated to all its
direct parents/ancestors as background. The final p-value takes the
maximum of both p-values in these two calculations.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;Notes&quot;: the order of the number of significant terms is: &quot;none&quot;
&gt; &quot;lea&quot; &gt; &quot;elim&quot; &gt; &quot;pc&quot;.
</p>
</li></ul>
