<h2>Table S2A for cis-eQTLs among shared datasets from Benjamin et al. (2014)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset involves 228 individuals with expression data for all four
conditions, that is, in the naive state (Naive), after 2-hour LPS
(LPS2), after 24-hour LPS (LPS24), and after exposure to IFN (IFN).
Local, likely cis-acting eQTL (referred to as cis-eQTL) were defined as
SNPs showing association with gene expression that were located within
a 1-Mb window of the associated probe. The eQTL analysis was performed
with the R package MatrixEQTL using an additive linear model, reporting
both test statistic and FDR.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
data(JKscience_TS2A)
</pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a data frame. It has the following columns: &quot;variant&quot; (cis-eQTLs),
&quot;ArrayAddress&quot; (illuminaHumanv4), &quot;GeneID&quot; (Entrez GeneID), &quot;Symbol&quot;
(gene symbol), &quot;Naive_t&quot; (test statistic for naive samples), &quot;LPS2_t&quot;,
&quot;LPS24_t&quot;, &quot;IFN_t&quot;, &quot;Naive_fdr&quot; (FDR for naive samples), &quot;LPS2_fdr&quot;,
&quot;LPS24_fdr&quot; and &quot;IFN_fdr&quot;.
